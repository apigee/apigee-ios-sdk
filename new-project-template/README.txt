Welcome to the Apigee App Services template app for iOS!

In order to compile and run this application, you must first add ApigeeiOSSDK.framework to this application.

App Services is Apigee’s hosted version of the open-source technology “Usergrid” — you may find references to that name in a few places. 

To get started, open this project in XCode: just double-click the file called “Apigee App Services iOS Template.xcodeproj” in the Finder.

You will need to make a few edits for this template to work. Follow the instructions in iOS Template/Client.m

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a visual confirmation when you run the app!


P.S.: You can install XCode from the Mac App Store. XCode is Mac only… You cannot develop iOS applications from anything but an Apple machine
